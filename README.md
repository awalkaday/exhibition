### *Leave your marks on my exhibitions (2025)*   

Welcome to an indoors exhibition of black-and-white photographs shot by __Chris-Armel Iradukunda (daqhris)__, showcased during __Brussels Art Week__ on the __4th__ (12:00-22:00), __5th__ and __6th__ (18:00-21:00) of __September 2025__.  

It's a couple of 3-dimensional exhibitions walking their first steps in the minds of visitors, from the virtual world to the physical walls, at __Hectolitre__ for 3 days. Next door or on other floors, your senses will also discover mind-blowing works of art presented by five artists-in-residence.
