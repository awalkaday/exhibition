// The building as three.js objects. Lit like a gallery, unlit where the art is:
// the walls take light so the rooms read as rooms, the paintings do not, so a
// piece on the wall is the same pixels the artist's program produced.
//
// The first build had #2a2a2a walls under a near-black ground light — "dark
// neutral, so the pictures are the light" taken literally — and a vertical wall
// got about six percent of the light, which every monitor shows as black; a
// second pass at #7a746c still read as a dim corridor. So: gallery white. Walls
// off-white, a light concrete floor, a flat white ceiling, a white sky with a
// mid-grey ground so undersides are not dark, a warm key down the spine and a
// cool fill from the other side, and a pool of warm lamplight on the wall
// behind every painting. The pictures are still the brightest thing in the room.

 * is plain dark concrete.
 *
 * It went darker still — 0x5f5b56 to 0x2a2724 — and that is not a free number.
