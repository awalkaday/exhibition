// Standing in front of a painting, and where it lands on the screen.
//
// When the camera is on a painting's normal, level, looking straight at it, the
// painting is a rectangle parallel to the image plane — so its projection is an
// axis-aligned rectangle in CSS pixels, and a plain DOM element can be laid over
// it exactly. That is what lets the sandboxed piece run "on the wall" with no
// CSS3D compositing: the camera is steered to the one pose where a 2-D overlay is
// correct, and the overlay is PieceFrame, unchanged.
