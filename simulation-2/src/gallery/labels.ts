// The signs — lobby title, era names, room names, and a plaque under every
// painting — are text, and text on a wall is a texture. There are about 470
// strings, so they are drawn once into one canvas at load and the signs become
// one quad mesh with UVs into it, the same trick as the painting atlases but
// built in the browser because the text is in the JSON and a font is here.

 * again as big now, so the compensation can come down with the size going up.
 * It has to, as well. The atlas was already packing to 3796 of its 4096 rows, and
 * holding 2 here pushed the packer into its retry — which costs every sign in the
 * building a fifth of its resolution to buy plaques something they no longer need.
 *
 * 1.4 rather than 1.5 because 1.5 still tips the 2048 atlas, the one low-end
 * devices get, into that retry. At 1.4 both sizes pack at full resolution, with
 * 184 rows to spare at 4096 and 38 at 2048, and a plaque's box comes to 50 px
 * against the 48 it had at half the size — so the text is larger on the wall and
 * fractionally sharper, rather than larger and softer. If signs are ever added,
 * check this again: 2048 is the one with little room left.
