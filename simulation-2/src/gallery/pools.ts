// The pool of light a museum lamp throws on the wall around a picture.
//
// A real spotlight per painting would be four hundred lights, and every one of
// them a set of uniforms in every wall shader — three.js forward-renders, so that
// is the shader melting, not a stylistic choice. What a visitor actually sees of
// a picture light is the soft bright patch on the wall behind the frame, and
// that is a texture: one radial falloff, drawn once, stamped behind every
// painting as an additive quad, all of them one mesh and one draw call.
//
// The texture is computed rather than drawn on a canvas so it exists wherever
// three does — including jsdom, where there is no 2-D context and the labels
// therefore go missing.
