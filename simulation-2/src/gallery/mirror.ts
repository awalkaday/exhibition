// The reflection in the floor, done the old way: render the room a second time
// from a camera mirrored through the floor plane, and lay it over the concrete,
// faintly.
//
// This replaced screen-space reflections, which could only ever reflect what was
// already on the screen — so a painting reflected until it left the top of the
// view and then tore away, worst at the edges. A mirrored re-render has nothing
// missing: it draws the same scene, walls and all, so what lands in the floor is
// what is actually standing in the room, out to the far end of the corridor.
//
// It costs a whole extra pass over the geometry each frame, which is why it is
// behind the same desktop-only switch SSR was, and why its target is small: a
// reflection in polished concrete is low-frequency, and softness helps it.
