// Turning a hue derived from the art into a colour something can be painted.
//
// Two places need this and they want it at very different strengths. A wall is a
// background and takes a wash you would struggle to name; a vase is an object and
// can be properly coloured. Both are the same operation — keep the base colour's
// brightness, add the art's hue as saturation — so it lives here rather than
// being written out twice with two chances to drift.
