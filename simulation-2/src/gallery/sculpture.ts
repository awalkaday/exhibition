// Sculpture on plinths, for the one room big enough to have empty floor in it.
//
// The 20 m room reads as a field with pictures round the edge, so nine chamfered
// plinths stand in a 3 x 3 grid in the middle of it, each carrying a small object
// generated from a seed. Two generators, checkerboarded so neither clusters: a
// lathe VASE turned from a couple of sine curves, and a TERRACE — a square cut
// down after Frank's own Divide By Circle: rectangles split again and again with
// a disc scored through them, packed and domed inside it, scattered outside.
//
// Low poly and one draw call, both deliberate. One draw call means plinths and
// sculptures share a single material and tell themselves apart with vertex
// colours — the same attribute the walls use for their paint. Eighteen objects
// come to roughly three thousand triangles.
//
// Shading is split, and on purpose. The plinths and the terrace are flat-shaded,
// because their facets ARE the shape: a terrace of blocks wants every edge to
// read. The vase is smooth-shaded from the analytic normal of a surface of
// revolution, because a vase is a turned thing and twelve visible flats make it
// a prism instead. Low poly is the silhouette, not an excuse to fake the normals.
//
// The seeds are the room's own art: each plinth takes the fxhash project id of
// one of the pieces hanging around it, so the objects are generated from the
// work on the walls, and the room's contents are stable as long as its art is.
// Each object is then coloured by that same piece, so a vase is the colour of
// the picture it came from — which is hanging a few metres away.

 * Closed boxes rather than a heightfield because the blocks no longer line up on
 * a grid, so there is no neighbour to measure a skirt against; and the gap
 * because two abutting boxes would otherwise share a face exactly, which is a
 * z-fight. The gap earns its keep besides — it is what makes the cuts legible.
 *
 * The walk is normalised first and the disc's lift and dome added afterwards. The
 * other way round, one lucky block out in the field would scale the dome away —
 * the mound has to be a fact about the circle, not about the tallest cell.
