# Leave *your* marks on *my* exhibitions

## _dear visiting guest,_

Use any web browser, on any computer, from anywhere.  
Step into a fast-moving tunnel, skip asking *[daqhris](https://daqhris.com)* for keys.  
Pass through its open door, on the way to a virtual exhibition.  
Walk around, left and right, front and back, as *you* wish.   
Unlock the guestbook with *your* digital identity keys.  
Remember to write down *your* mark, onsite, online!

## _do not exit, yet._  

Afterward, walk into another open door at [Hectolitre](http://hectolitre.space).  
*Your* marks are excited to be left on centennial walls!  
*Your* electronic identity card stays at home when visiting.  
*I* will hand you writing tools inside of the lookalike walls.  
*Our* walls keep the exhibition obedient to physical laws.  
The brick-and-mortar art exhibition is housed in [Brussels](https://www.brussels.be/brussels-art-week).

## _do not exit, yet, please._  

What’s on *your* human mind, *my* dear?  
Black and white walls are waiting for *you*.  
Let’s leave a mark on the exhibition walls, *I* and *you*.  
Ears of *our* bodies will be listening to a single audio.  
Every in-person visit will end with one digital photo!  

## _close, windows, then doors._  

Exit the exhibitions, when *your* face smiles, before the next sunrise.  
*Your* mark's photo will be hung on cyber walls after the moonrise.
