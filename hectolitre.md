# dear guest, draw on my 3D walls

use any web browser, on any brand of computers.  
step into a tunnel, leading to a [virtual exhibition](https://oncyber.io/awalkaday.art).  
walk around, it’s a simulated room in cyberspace.  
unlock its door, with *your* digital identity keys.  
write down *your* words, in the online guestbook.  

## do not exit, yet.  

come after, to see *your* words, at [Hectolitre](http://hectolitre.space).  
your name gets written on centennial walls.  
*[daqhris](https://daqhris.com)* hands you a chalk to draw on walls.  
the walls keep the physical exhibition warm.  
an exhibition housed in the city of [Brussels](https://www.brussels.be/).  

## do not exit, yet, please.  

what’s on your human mind?  
the walls are waiting for you.  
let’s draw, silently, together.  
our ears get wired to one audio.  
every visit ends with one photo.  

## close, windows and doors.  

### exit, in person, end here.
