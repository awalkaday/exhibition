# leave *your* mark on a 2-in-1 exhibition

## dear guest,

use any web browser, on any computer, from anywhere.  
step into a fast-moving tunnel, without asking *[daqhris](https://daqhris.com)* for keys.  
pass through its open door, on the way to a [virtual exhibition](https://oncyber.io/awalkaday.art).  
walk around, left and right, front and back, as *you* want.   
unlock the guestbook with *your* digital identity keys.  
remember to leave *your* mark, forever, onsite, online.  

## do not exit, yet.  

afterward, walk into another open door at [Hectolitre](http://hectolitre.space).  
*your* marks are excited to be left on centennial walls.  
leave your electronic identity keys at home when visiting.  
*he* will hand you drawing tools near the lookalike walls.  
*our* walls keep the exhibition obedient to physical laws.  
it's a brick-and-mortar exhibition housed in [Brussels](https://www.brussels.be/).  

## do not exit, yet, please.  

what’s on *your* human mind, *my* dear?  
black-and-white walls are waiting for *you*.  
let’s play and mark the exhibition walls, *I* and *you*.  
ears of *our* bodies will be listening to a single audio.  
every in-person visit will end with one digital photo!  

## close, windows, then doors.  

exit, when *your* face smiles, before the next day.  
*your* mark's photo will be uploaded the day after.
