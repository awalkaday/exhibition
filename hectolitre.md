# dear guest, leave your mark on my exhibition

use any web browser, on any brand of computers.  
step into a tunnel, leading to a [virtual exhibition](https://oncyber.io/awalkaday.art).  
walk around, left and right, front and back.
*you* are inside a simulated room in cyberspace.  
unlock its door, with *your* digital identity keys.  
write down *your* words, in the online guestbook.  

## do not exit, yet.  

come after, walk into an open doors at [Hectolitre](http://hectolitre.space).  
*your* words are excited to belong on centennial walls.  
*[daqhris](https://daqhris.com)* hands you a chalk to draw.  
the walls keep the 3D exhibition clean and warm.  
an exhibition housed in the city of [Brussels](https://www.brussels.be/).  

## do not exit, yet, please.  

what’s on your human mind?  
the white walls are waiting for you.  
let’s draw, playfully, I and you.  
our ears get wired to one audio.  
every visit ends with one photo.  

## close, windows, then doors.  

### exit, in person, end here.
